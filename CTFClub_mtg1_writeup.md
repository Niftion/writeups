### Dr. B. Breaker's Barely Bestirring Brick Breaker:
This brick breaker game was a bit special; it was set up to have a comically slow ball! No worries though: The variables to the website's game were exposed. This makes exploiting it rather easy: 

In the JS terminal, simply set score = 1000 (or any other excessively high value); this allows the user to win the game upon death because they have (obviously) earned the score of 1000. Much faster than breaking all the bricks manually (i.e., we are now balling).

*Note: Other variables, such as the ball's speed, were exposed too; just, changing the score value was the fastest path to victory.*

### Dr. Ralph Fleur's Baffling Raffle:
So, this raffle/lottery-esque game was not *inherently* set up to be unfair. Just, who has time to spin the wheel that many times? (no offense, gambling addicts)

Fortunately, there was an issue in this game's implementation: it ONLY checked for integers! Thus: if we passed a value OTHER than an integer to each of the "number guessing" boxes, the game will return the flag!

This is because (naturally) a non-integer value will never be less-than or greater-than each correct integer value generated by the game. Thus, by this logic, each non-integer is the answer, as if it is not greater-than or less-than our answer, it has no other choice than to *be* our answer (naturally).
